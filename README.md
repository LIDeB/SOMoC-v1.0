ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Compounds Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**SOMoC**

SOMoC is a clustering methodology based on the combination of molecular fingerprinting, dimensionality reduction by the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm and clustering with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm.
